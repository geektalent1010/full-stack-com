We are going to use [Seed](https://seed.run) to automate our serverless deployments and manage our environments.

Start by signing up for a free account [here](https://console.seed.run/signup).

Let's **Add your first app**.

Now to add your project, select **GitHub** as your git provider. You'll be asked to give Seed permission to your GitHub account.

Select the repo we've been using so far.

Next, Seed will scan your repos for a `serverless.yml`. Hit **Add Service** to confirm this.

Note that, if your `serverless.yml` is not in your project root, you will need to change the path.

Seed deploys to your AWS account on your behalf. You should create a separate IAM user with exact permissions that your project needs. You can read more about this [here](https://seed.run/docs/customizing-your-iam-policy). But for now we'll simply use the one we've used in this tutorial.

<img class="code-marker" src="/assets/s.png" />Run the following command.

``` bash
$ cat ~/.aws/credentials
```

The output should look something like this.

```
[default]
aws_access_key_id = YOUR_IAM_ACCESS_KEY
aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_IAM_SECRET_KEY
```

Seed will also create a couple of stages (or environments) for you. By default, it'll create a **dev** and a **prod** stage using the same AWS credentials. You can customize these but for us this is perfect.

Fill in the credentials and click **Add a New App**.

You new app is ready to go!

You'll notice a few things here. First, we have a service called **notes-app-2-api**. It's picking up the service name from our `serverless.yml`. You can choose to change this by clicking on the service and editing its name. A Serverless app can have multiple services within it. A service (roughly speaking) is a reference to a `serverless.yml` file. In our case we have one service in the root of our repo. You'll also notice the two stages that have been created.

Now before we proceed to deploying our app, we need to enable running unit tests as a part of our build process. You'll recall that we had added a couple of tests back in the [unit tests]({% link _chapters/unit-tests-in-serverless.md %}) chapter. And we want to run those before we deploy our app.

To do this, hit the **Settings** link and click **Enable Unit Tests**.

Back in our pipeline, you'll notice that our **dev** stage is hooked up to master. This means that any commits to master will trigger a build in dev.

Click on **dev**.

You'll see that we haven't deployed to this stage yet.

However, before we do that, we'll need to add our secret environment variables.
