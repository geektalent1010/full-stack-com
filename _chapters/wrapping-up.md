So we've covered how to build and deploy our backend serverless API and our frontend serverless app. And not only does it work well on the desktop.

It's mobile optimized as well!

The process of creating our app might have been quite long, but this guide is meant to be more of a learning process. You should be able to take what you've learned from here and adapt it to better suit your workflow. We are also going to be adding tools to help you work on your projects. You can find them in the [tools section](/#tools) in our homepage.

We'd love to hear from you about your experience following this guide. Please send us any comments or feedback you might have, via [email](mailto:{{ site.email }}). We'd love to feature your comments here. Also, if you'd like us to cover any of the chapters or concepts in a bit more detail, feel free to [let us know](mailto:{{ site.email }}).

Thank you and we hope you found this guide helpful!
