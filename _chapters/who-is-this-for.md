This guide is meant for full-stack developers or people that want to build full stack applications. By providing a step-by-step guide for both the frontend and the backend we hope that it addresses all the different aspects of building serverless applications. There are quite a few other tutorials out there but we think it would be useful to have a single point of reference for the entire process.

So you might be a backend developer who would like to learn more about the frontend portion of building serverless apps or vice-versa; this guide should have you covered.
