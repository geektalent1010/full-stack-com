As we continue to update Serverless Stack, we want to make sure that we give you a clear idea of all the changes that are being made. This is to ensure that you won't have to go through the entire tutorial again to get caught up on the updates. We also want to leave the older versions up in case you need a reference. This is also useful for readers who are working through the tutorial while it gets updated.

Below are the updates weâ€™ve made to Serverless Stack, each with:

- Each update has a link to an **archived version of the tutorial**
- Updates to the tutorial **compared to the last version**
- Updates to the **API and Client repos**

While the hosted version of the tutorial and the code snippets are accurate, the sample project repo that is linked at the bottom of each chapter is unfortunately not. We do however maintain the past versions of the completed sample project repo. So you should be able to use those to figure things out. All this info is also available on the [releases page]({{ site.github_repo }}/releases) of our [GitHub repo]({{ site.github_repo }}).

You can get these updates emailed to you via our [newsletter]({{ site.mailchimp_signup_form }}).
