description: To add links to the Navbar of our React.js app weâ€™ll be using the NavItem React-Bootstrap component. And to allow users to navigate using these links we are going to use React-Router's Route component and call the history.push method.

Now that we have our first route set up, let's add a couple of links to the navbar of our app. These will direct users to login or signup for our app when they first visit it.

<img class="code-marker" src="/assets/s.png" />Replace the `render` method in `src/App.js` with the following.

``` coffee
render() {
  return (
    <div className="App container">
      <Navbar fluid collapseOnSelect>
        <Navbar.Header>
          <Navbar.Brand>
            <Link to="/">Scratch</Link>
          </Navbar.Brand>
          <Navbar.Toggle />
        </Navbar.Header>
        <Navbar.Collapse>
          <Nav pullRight>
            <NavItem href="/signup">Signup</NavItem>
            <NavItem href="/login">Login</NavItem>
          </Nav>
        </Navbar.Collapse>
      </Navbar>
      <Routes />
    </div>
  );
}
```

This adds two links to our navbar using the `NavItem` Bootstrap component. The `Navbar.Collapse` component ensures that on mobile devices the two links will be collapsed.

And let's include the necessary components in the header.

<img class="code-marker" src="/assets/s.png" />Replace the `react-router-dom` and `react-bootstrap` import in `src/App.js` with this.

``` coffee
import { Link } from "react-router-dom";
import { Nav, Navbar, NavItem } from "react-bootstrap";
```

Now if you flip over to your browser, you should see the two links in our navbar.

Unfortunately, they don't do a whole lot when you click on them. We also need them to highlight when we navigate to that page. To fix this we are going to use a useful feature of the React-Router. We are going to use the `Route` component to detect when we are on a certain page and then render based on it. Since we are going to do this twice, let's make this into a component that can be re-used.

<img class="code-marker" src="/assets/s.png" />Create a `src/components/` directory and add the following inside `src/components/RouteNavItem.js`.

``` coffee
import React from "react";
import { Route } from "react-router-dom";
import { NavItem } from "react-bootstrap";

export default props =>
  <Route
    path={props.href}
    exact
    children={({ match, history }) =>
      <NavItem
        onClick={e => history.push(e.currentTarget.getAttribute("href"))}
        {...props}
        active={match ? true : false}
      >
        {props.children}
      </NavItem>}
  />;
```

This is doing a couple of things here:

1. We look at the `href` for the `NavItem` and check if there is a match.

2. React-Router passes in a `match` object in case there is a match. We use that and set the `active` prop for the `NavItem`.

3. React-Router also passes us a `history` object. We use this to navigate to the new page using `history.push`.

Now let's use this component.

<img class="code-marker" src="/assets/s.png" />Import this component in the header of our `src/App.js`.

``` coffee
import RouteNavItem from "./components/RouteNavItem";
```

<img class="code-marker" src="/assets/s.png" />And remove the `NavItem` from the header of `src/App.js`, so that the `react-bootstrap` import looks like this.

``` coffee
import { Nav, Navbar } from "react-bootstrap";
```

<img class="code-marker" src="/assets/s.png" />Now replace the `NavItem` components in `src/App.js`.

``` coffee
<NavItem href="/signup">Signup</NavItem>
<NavItem href="/login">Login</NavItem>
```

<img class="code-marker" src="/assets/s.png" />With the following.

``` coffee
<RouteNavItem href="/signup">Signup</RouteNavItem>
<RouteNavItem href="/login">Login</RouteNavItem>
```

And that's it! Now if you flip over to your browser and click on the login link, you should see the link highlighted in the navbar.

You'll notice that we are not rendering anything on the page because we don't have a login page currently. We should handle the case when a requested page is not found.

Next let's look at how to tackle handling 404s with our router.
