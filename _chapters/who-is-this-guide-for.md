This guide is meant for full-stack developers or developers that would like to build full stack serverless applications. By providing a step-by-step guide for both the frontend and the backend we hope that it addresses all the different aspects of building serverless applications. There are quite a few other tutorials on the web but we think it would be useful to have a single point of reference for the entire process. This guide is meant to serve as a resource for learning about how to build and deploy serverless applications, as opposed to laying out the best possible way of doing so.

So you might be a backend developer who would like to learn more about the frontend portion of building serverless apps or a frontend developer that would like to learn more about the backend; this guide should have you covered.

Let's start by looking at what we'll be covering.
