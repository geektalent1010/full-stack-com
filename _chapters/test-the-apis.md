title: Test the APIs

description: To test a serverless backend API secured using IAM and Cognito User Pool you need to follow a few steps. First, generate a user token by authenticating with the User Pool. Then use the user token to get a set of temporary IAM credentials using the Identity Pool. Finally, sign the API request using the IAM credentials using Signature Version 4 and make the request. To simplify this process we are going to use the “aws-api-gateway-cli-test” tool.

Now that we have our backend completely set up and secured, let's test the API we just deployed.

To be able to hit our API endpoints securely, we need to follow these steps.

1. Authenticate against our User Pool and acquire a user token.
2. With the user token get temporary IAM credentials from our Identity Pool.
3. Use the IAM credentials to sign our API request with [Signature Version 4](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html).

These steps can be a bit tricky to do by hand. So we created a simple tool called [AWS API Gateway Test CLI](https://github.com/AnomalyInnovations/aws-api-gateway-cli-test).

You can install it by running the following.

``` bash
$ npm install -g aws-api-gateway-cli-test
```

We need to pass in quite a bit of our info to complete the above steps.

- Use the username and password of the user created in the [Create a Cognito test user]({% link _chapters/create-a-cognito-test-user.md %}) chapter.
- Replace **YOUR_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID**, **YOUR_COGNITO_APP_CLIENT_ID**, and **YOUR_COGNITO_REGION** with the values from the [Create a Cognito user pool]({% link _chapters/create-a-cognito-user-pool.md %}) chapter. In our case the region is `us-east-1`.
- Replace **YOUR_IDENTITY_POOL_ID** with the one from the [Create a Cognito identity pool]({% link _chapters/create-a-cognito-identity-pool.md %}) chapter.
- Use the **YOUR_API_GATEWAY_URL** and **YOUR_API_GATEWAY_REGION** with the ones from the [Deploy the APIs]({% link _chapters/deploy-the-apis.md %}) chapter. In our case the URL is `https://ly55wbovq4.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod` and the region is `us-east-1`.

And run the following.

``` bash
apig-test \
--username='admin@example.com' \
--password='Passw0rd!' \
--user-pool-id='YOUR_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID' \
--app-client-id='YOUR_COGNITO_APP_CLIENT_ID' \
--cognito-region='YOUR_COGNITO_REGION' \
--identity-pool-id='YOUR_IDENTITY_POOL_ID' \
--invoke-url='YOUR_API_GATEWAY_URL' \
--api-gateway-region='YOUR_API_GATEWAY_REGION' \
--path-template='/notes' \
--method='POST' \
--body='{"content":"hello world","attachment":"hello.jpg"}'
```
For Windows users (the space between each command is very important): 

``` bash
apig-test --username admin@example.com --password Passw0rd! --user-pool-id YOUR_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID --app-client-id YOUR_COGNITO_APP_CLIENT_ID --cognito-region YOUR_COGNITO_REGION --identity-pool-id YOUR_IDENTITY_POOL_ID --invoke-url YOUR_API_GATEWAY_URL --api-gateway-region YOUR_API_GATEWAY_REGION --path-template notes --method POST --body "{\"content\":\"hello world\",\"attachment\":\"hello.jpg\"}"
```

While this might look intimidating, just keep in mind that behind the scenes all we are doing is generating some security headers before making a basic HTTP request. You'll see more of this process when we connect our React.js app to our API backend.

If the command is successful, the response will look similar to this.

``` bash
Authenticating with User Pool
Getting temporary credentials
Making API request
{ status: 200,
  statusText: 'OK',
  data: 
   { userId: 'us-east-1:9bdc031d-ee9e-4ffa-9a2d-123456789',
     noteId: '8f7da030-650b-11e7-a661-123456789',
     content: 'hello world',
     attachment: 'hello.jpg',
     createdAt: 1499648598452 } }
```

And that's it for the backend! Next we are going to move on to creating the frontend of our app.

#### Common Issues

- Response `{status: false}`

  If your `apig-test` command fails with the `{status: false}` response; we can do a few things to debug this. This response is generated by our handler functions when there is an error. Add a `console.log` like so in your handler function.

  ``` javascript
  catch(e) {
    console.log(e);
    callback(null, failure({status: false}));
  }
  ```

  And deploy it using `serverless deploy`. But we can't see this output when we make an HTTP request to it, since the console logs are not sent in our HTTP responses. We need to check the logs to see this. Head over to your AWS Console > CloudWatch > click Logs in the sidebar > select the Log Group named `/aws/lambda/notes-app-api-prod-create` > and expand the events. This should give you an idea of the error and help you debug it.

  A common source of errors here is an improperly indented `serverless.yml`. Make sure to double-check the indenting in your `serverless.yml` to the one from [this chapter](https://github.com/AnomalyInnovations/serverless-stack-demo-api/blob/master/serverless.yml).
  
- Response `{ status: 403,
  statusText: 'Forbidden'}`
**Things you can try:**  
  1. Most probably 403 is coming from API Gateway. API Gateway logs are not on by default and are a little trickier to turn on. Can you try this - https://kennbrodhagen.net/2016/07/23/how-to-enable-logging-for-api-gateway/
  
  2. Whenever you deploy, in order for your Lambda to write events to CloudWatch, Serverless creates an IAM ROLE policy that grants this permission, and you usualy find it by going to AWS/IAM/Roles witht the name `appName-prod-eu-west-1-lambdaRole`. Click on it and you will see a list of actions you can take.
  
   Open the IAM policy simulator

    Insert the ARN of the database table you want to test

    Then click Run Simulation.

3. Check the policy permisions for you're Lambda Role
