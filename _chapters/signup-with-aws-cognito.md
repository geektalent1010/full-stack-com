title: Signup with AWS Cognito
date: 2017-01-21 00:00:00
description: To implement a signup form in our React.js app using Amazon Cognito we are going to use the amazon-cognito-identity-js NPM package. We are going to call the signUp method to sign a user up and call the confirmRegistration method with the confirmation code to complete the process.

Now let's go ahead and implement the `handleSubmit` and `handleConfirmationSubmit` methods and connect it up with our AWS Cognito setup.

<img class="code-marker" src="/assets/s.png" />Replace our `handleSubmit` and `handleConfirmationSubmit` methods in `src/containers/Signup.js` with the following.

``` javascript
handleSubmit = async event => {
  event.preventDefault();

  this.setState({ isLoading: true });

  try {
    const newUser = await this.signup(this.state.email, this.state.password);
    this.setState({
      newUser: newUser
    });
  } catch (e) {
    alert(e);
  }

  this.setState({ isLoading: false });
}

handleConfirmationSubmit = async event => {
  event.preventDefault();

  this.setState({ isLoading: true });

  try {
    await this.confirm(this.state.newUser, this.state.confirmationCode);
    await this.authenticate(
      this.state.newUser,
      this.state.email,
      this.state.password
    );

    this.props.userHasAuthenticated(true);
    this.props.history.push("/");
  } catch (e) {
    alert(e);
    this.setState({ isLoading: false });
  }
}

signup(email, password) {
  const userPool = new CognitoUserPool({
    UserPoolId: config.cognito.USER_POOL_ID,
    ClientId: config.cognito.APP_CLIENT_ID
  });

  return new Promise((resolve, reject) =>
    userPool.signUp(email, password, [], null, (err, result) => {
      if (err) {
        reject(err);
        return;
      }

      resolve(result.user);
    })
  );
}

confirm(user, confirmationCode) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) =>
    user.confirmRegistration(confirmationCode, true, function(err, result) {
      if (err) {
        reject(err);
        return;
      }
      resolve(result);
    })
  );
}

authenticate(user, email, password) {
  const authenticationData = {
    Username: email,
    Password: password
  };
  const authenticationDetails = new AuthenticationDetails(authenticationData);

  return new Promise((resolve, reject) =>
    user.authenticateUser(authenticationDetails, {
      onSuccess: result => resolve(),
      onFailure: err => reject(err)
    })
  );
}
```

<img class="code-marker" src="/assets/s.png" />Also, include the following in our header.

``` javascript
import {
  AuthenticationDetails,
  CognitoUserPool
} from "amazon-cognito-identity-js";
import config from "../config";
```

The flow here is pretty simple:

1. In `handleSubmit` we make a call to signup a user. This creates a new user object.

2. Save that user object to the state as `newUser`.

3. In `handleConfirmationSubmit` use the confirmation code to confirm the user.

4. With the user now confirmed, Cognito now knows that we have a new user that can login to our app.

5. Use the email and password to authenticate the newly created user using the `newUser` object that we had previously saved in the state.

6. Update the App's state using the `userHasAuthenticated` method.

7. Finally, redirect to the homepage.

Now if you were to switch over to your browser and try signing up for a new account it should redirect you to the homepage after sign up successfully completes.

A quick note on the signup flow here. If the user refreshes their page at the confirm step, they won't be able to get back and confirm that account. It forces them to create a new account instead. We are keeping things intentionally simple here but you can fix this by creating a separate page that handles the confirm step based on the email address. [Here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/using-amazon-cognito-user-identity-pools-javascript-examples.html#using-amazon-cognito-identity-user-pools-javascript-example-confirming-user) is some sample code that you can use to confirm an unauthenticated user.

However, while developing you might run into cases where you need to manually confirm an unauthenticated user. You can do that with the AWS CLI using the following command.

```bash
aws cognito-idp admin-confirm-sign-up \
   --region us-east-1 \
   --user-pool-id YOUR_USER_POOL_ID \
   --username YOUR_USER_EMAIL
```

Just be sure to use your Cognito User Pool Id and the email you used to create the account.

Next up, we are going to create our first note.
