description: We should give users some feedback while we are logging them in to our React.js app. To do so we are going to create a component that animates a Glyphicon refresh icon inside a React-Bootstrap Button component. Weâ€™ll do the animation while the log in call is in progress.

It's important that we give the user some feedback while we are logging them in. So they get the sense that the app is still working, as opposed to being unresponsive.

### Use an isLoading Flag

<img class="code-marker" src="/assets/s.png" />To do this we are going to add an `isLoading` flag to the state of our `src/containers/Login.js`. Add the following to the top of our `Login` function component.

``` javascript
const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);
```

<img class="code-marker" src="/assets/s.png" />And we'll update it while we are logging in. So our `handleSubmit` function now looks like so:

``` javascript
async function handleSubmit(event) {
  event.preventDefault();

  setIsLoading(true);

  try {
    await Auth.signIn(email, password);
    props.userHasAuthenticated(true);
    props.history.push("/");
  } catch (e) {
    alert(e.message);
    setIsLoading(false);
  }
}
```

### Create a Loader Button

Now to reflect the state change in our button we are going to render it differently based on the `isLoading` flag. But we are going to need this piece of code in a lot of different places. So it makes sense that we create a reusable component out of it.

<img class="code-marker" src="/assets/s.png" />Create a new file and add the following in `src/components/LoaderButton.js`.

``` coffee
import React from "react";
import { Button, Glyphicon } from "react-bootstrap";
import "./LoaderButton.css";

export default function LoaderButton({
  isLoading,
  className = "",
  disabled = false,
  ...props
}) {
  return (
    <Button
      className={`LoaderButton ${className}`}
      disabled={disabled || isLoading}
      {...props}
    >
      {isLoading && <Glyphicon glyph="refresh" className="spinning" />}
      {props.children}
    </Button>
  );
}
```

This is a really simple component that takes an `isLoading` flag and the text that the button displays in the two states (the default state and the loading state). The `disabled` prop is a result of what we have currently in our `Login` button. And we ensure that the button is disabled when `isLoading` is `true`. This makes it so that the user can't click it while we are in the process of logging them in.

And let's add a couple of styles to animate our loading icon.

<img class="code-marker" src="/assets/s.png" />Add the following to `src/components/LoaderButton.css`.

``` css
.LoaderButton .spinning.glyphicon {
  margin-right: 7px;
  top: 2px;
  animation: spin 1s infinite linear;
}
@keyframes spin {
  from { transform: scale(1) rotate(0deg); }
  to { transform: scale(1) rotate(360deg); }
}
```

This spins the refresh Glyphicon infinitely with each spin taking a second. And by adding these styles as a part of the `LoaderButton` we keep them self contained within the component.

### Render Using the isLoading Flag

Now we can use our new component in our `Login` container.

<img class="code-marker" src="/assets/s.png" />In `src/containers/Login.js` find the `<Button>` component in the `return` statement.

``` html
<Button block bsSize="large" disabled={!validateForm()} type="submit">
  Login
</Button>
```

<img class="code-marker" src="/assets/s.png" />And replace it with this.

``` html
<LoaderButton
  block
  type="submit"
  bsSize="large"
  isLoading={isLoading}
  disabled={!validateForm()}
>
  Login
</LoaderButton>
```

<img class="code-marker" src="/assets/s.png" />Also, import the `LoaderButton` in the header. And remove the reference to the `Button` component.

``` javascript
import { FormGroup, FormControl, ControlLabel } from "react-bootstrap";
import LoaderButton from "../components/LoaderButton";
```

And now when we switch over to the browser and try logging in, you should see the intermediate state before the login completes.

If you would like to add _Forgot Password_ functionality for your users, you can refer to our [Extra Credit series of chapters on user management]({% link _chapters/manage-user-accounts-in-aws-amplify.md %}).

Next let's implement the sign up process for our app.
