To step through the major concepts involved in building web applications, we are going to be building a simple note taking app called [Scratch](https://demo.serverless-stack.com).

It is a single page application powered by a serverless API written completely in JavaScript. Here is the complete source for the [backend]({{ site.backend_github_repo }}) and the [frontend]({{ site.frontend_github_repo }}). It is a relatively simple application but we are going need to address the following requirements.

- Should allow users to signup and login to their accounts
- Users should be able to create notes with some content
- Each note can also have an uploaded file as an attachment
- Allow users to modify their note and the attachment
- Users can also delete their notes
- App should be served over HTTPS on a custom domain
- The backend APIs need to be secure
- The app needs to be responsive

We'll be using the AWS Platform to build it. We might expand further and cover a few other platforms but we figured the AWS Platform would be a good place to start. We'll be using the following set of technologies to build our serverless application. 

- [Lambda][Lambda] & [API Gateway][APIG] for our serverless API
- [DynamoDB][DynamoDB] for our database
- [Cognito][Cognito] for user authentication and securing our APIs
- [S3][S3] for hosting our app and file uploads
- [CloudFront][CF] for serving out our app
- [Route 53][R53] for our domain
- [Certificate Manager][CM] for SSL
- [React.js][React] for our single page app
- [React Router][RR] for routing
- [Bootstrap][Bootstrap] for the UI Kit

While the list above might look daunting, we are trying to ensure that upon completing the guide you'll be ready to build **real-world**, **secure**, and **fully-functional** web apps. And don't worry we'll be around to help!

The guide covers the following concepts in order.

For the backend:

- Configure your AWS account
- Create your database using DynamoDB
- Setup S3 for file uploads
- Setup Cognito User Pools to manage user accounts
- Setup Cognito Identity Pool to secure our file uploads
- Setup the Serverless Framework to work with Lambda & API Gateway
- Write the various backend APIs

For the frontend:

- Setup our project with Create React App
- Add favicons, fonts, and a UI Kit using Bootstrap
- Setup routes using React-Router
- Use AWS Cognito SDK to login and signup users
- Plugin to the backend APIs to manage our notes
- Use the AWS JS SDK to upload files 
- Create an S3 bucket to upload our app
- Configure CloudFront to serve out our app
- Point our domain with Route 53 to CloudFront
- Setup SSL to serve our app over HTTPS

We think this will give you a good foundation on building full-stack serverless applications. If there are any other concepts or technologies you'd like us to cover, feel free to let us know via [email](mailto:{{ site.email }}).
