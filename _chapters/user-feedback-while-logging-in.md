title: User Feedback While Logging In
---

It's important that we give the user some feedback while we are logging them in. So they get the sense that are app is still working as opposed to being unresponsive.

### Use a isLoading Flag

To do this we are going to add a `isLoading` flag to the state of our `Login` component. So our initial state in the `constructor` looks like the following.

{% highlight javascript %}
this.state = {
  isLoading: false,
  username: '',
  password: '',
};
{% endhighlight %}

And we'll update it while we are logging in. So our `handleSubmit` method now looks like the following.

{% highlight javascript %}
handleSubmit = async (event) => {
  event.preventDefault();

  this.setState({ isLoading: true });

  try {
    const userToken = await this.login(this.state.username, this.state.password);
    this.props.updateUserToken(userToken);
    this.props.router.push('/');
  }
  catch(e) {
    alert(e);
    this.setState({ isLoading: false });
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

### Create a Loader Button

Now to reflect the state change in our button we are going to render it differently based on the `isLoading` flag. But we are going to need this piece of code in a lot of different places. So it makes sense that we create a reusable component out of it.

Create the following in `src/components/LoaderButton.js`.

{% highlight javascript %}
import React from 'react';
import { Button } from 'react-bootstrap';

export default function LoaderButton({ isLoading, text, loadingText, disabled = false, ...props }) {
  return (
    <Button disabled={ disabled || isLoading } {...props}>
      { ! isLoading ? text : loadingText }
    </Button>
  );
}
{% endhighlight %}

This is a really simple component that simply taken a `isLoading` flag and the text that the button displays in the two states (ie, the default state and the loading state). The `disabled` prop is a result of what we have currently in our `Login` button. And ensure that the button is disabled when `isLoading` is `true`.

### Render Using the isLoading Flag

Now finally we can use our new component in our `Login` container. Let's start by replacing the `<Button>` element in the `render` method using the following.

{% highlight javascript %}
<LoaderButton
  disabled={ ! this.validateForm() }
  type="submit"
  isLoading={this.state.isLoading}
  text="Login"
  loadingText="Logging inâ€¦" />
{% endhighlight %}

Import the `LoaderButton` in the header. And remove the reference to the `Button` component.

{% highlight javascript %}
import {
  FormGroup,
  FormControl,
  ControlLabel,
} from 'react-bootstrap';
import LoaderButton from '../components/LoaderButton.js';
{% endhighlight %}

And finally, disable the form from submitting while it is loading. Just replace the opening `<form>` tag with the following.

{% highlight javascript %}
<form onSubmit={ ! this.state.isLoading ? this.handleSubmit : null }>
{% endhighlight %}

And now when we switch over to the browser and try logging in, you should see the intermediate state before the login completes.

Next let's implement the sign up process for our app.
