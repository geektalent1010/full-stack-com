In case you find yourself having problems with a certain step, we want to make sure that we are around to help you fix it and figure it out. There are a few ways to get help.

- Use the live chat button on the bottom right of the page to send us your questions.
- Or if we are not around, send us an [email](mailto:{{ site.email }}). We will make sure to respond within a day.

Also, this entire guide is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/AnomalyInnovations/serverless-stack-com). So you can always:

- Open a [new issue](https://github.com/AnomalyInnovations/serverless-stack-com/issues/new) if you've found a bug or have some suggestions.
- Or if you've found a typo, edit the page and submit a pull request!
