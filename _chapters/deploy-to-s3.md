title: Deploy to S3

description: To use our React.js app in production we are going to use Create React Appâ€™s build command to create a production build of our app. And to upload our React.js app to an S3 Bucket on AWS, we are going to use the AWS CLI s3 sync command.

Now that our S3 Bucket is created we are ready to upload the assets of our app.

### Build Our App

Create React App comes with a convenient way to package and prepare our app for deployment. From our working directory simply run the following command.

``` bash
$ npm run build
```

This packages all of our assets and places them in the `build/` directory.

### Upload to S3

Now to deploy simply run the following command; where `YOUR_S3_DEPLOY_BUCKET_NAME` is the name of the S3 Bucket we created in the [Create an S3 bucket]({% link _chapters/create-an-s3-bucket.md %}) chapter.

``` bash
$ aws s3 sync build/ s3://YOUR_S3_DEPLOY_BUCKET_NAME
```

All this command does is that it syncs the `build/` directory with our bucket on S3. Just as a sanity check, go into the S3 section in your [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home) and check if your bucket has the files we just uploaded.

And our app should be live on S3! If you head over to the URL assigned to you (in my case it is [http://notes-app-client.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com](http://notes-app-client.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com)), you should see it live.

### App Bundle Size

Just a quick note on the size of our frontend app. The main JS file in our app is under `build/static/js/main.id.js` and it is quite large because of our AWS import. One of our readers did a bit of research on this and found a simple way to almost half the size of the bundle.

This step is optional for completing the tutorial but can be helpful if you are basing your projects on it. In our `src/libs/awsLib.js` you can replace the `import AWS from "aws-sdk";` with the following:

``` js
import AWS from 'aws-sdk/global';
import S3 from 'aws-sdk/clients/s3';
```

And when uploading a file to S3, replace `new AWS.S3({` with `new S3({` instead. You can read more about the changes [here]({{ site.frontend_github_repo }}/pull/15).

If you try deploying again, you should notice that your app bundle is a lot smaller.

Next we'll configure CloudFront to serve our app out globally.
