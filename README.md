  <b>Learn to Build Full-Stack Apps with Serverless and React</b>
</p>

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Serverless Stack](https://serverless-stack.com) is an open source guide for building and deploying full-stack apps using Serverless and React on AWS.

We are going to create a [note taking app](https://demo2.serverless-stack.com) from scratch using React.js, AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, and Cognito.

![Demo App](assets/completed-app-desktop.png)

It is a single-page React app powered by a serverless CRUD API. We also cover how add user authentication and handle file uploads.

The entire guide is hosted on GitHub and we use [Discourse][Discourse] for our comments. With the help of the community we keep the guide accurate and up to date.
