      <p>Rarely do tutorials neatly break things down into bite-sized steps. Even rarer do they clearly explain what each step is for and why it is necessary. The Serverless-Stack is the <u>Holy Grail</u> that does all three.</p>

      <p>I think this is the <u>best tech tutorial</u> I've read in the last 20 years. It's detailed, well-written, covers a multitude of the latest technologies, and the layout of each chapter makes the subject matter easy to digest. Cheers!</p>
