## About Us

[Serverless Stack](/) is written and maintained by Frank Wang ([@fanjiewang](https://twitter.com/fanjiewang)) &amp; Jay V ([@jayair](https://twitter.com/jayair)) from [Anomaly Innovations](http://anoma.ly). Frank does most of the backend, while Jay builds the frontend. We have been developing on the AWS Platform for nearly a decade. We have built web apps, iPhone and Android apps, in a variety of different environments and languages. We have experience in building everything from web apps that algorithmically process tens of millions of messages in real-time, to mobile apps that reached the top 100 in the App Store.

Over the years we've accumulated a ton of experience on how to build, deploy, and maintain applications on the AWS Platform. The serverless approach has been a giant revelation to us. If we had a chance to go back and do this all over again, there is no doubt we would have taken the serverless approach. The [pros]({% link _chapters/why-create-serverless-apps.md %}) simply outweigh the cons. And while we recognize that it is not for everybody; we wanted to create a resource that makes it easy to learn and get started. Serverless Stack is completely free and the website and comments are hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/AnomalyInnovations/serverless-stack-com).

Moving forward we're planning to build services that can help developers (and companies) build and maintain serverless applications. If you are considering adopting this approach at your organisation; we'd love to hear from you. Send us an [email](mailto:{{ site.email }}?subject=Hi, I would like to build serverless applications) and let's chat.
