[Serverless Stack (SST)](/) is a framework that makes it easy to build full-stack serverless applications. SST features a Live Lambda Development environment that allows you to work on your Lambda functions live. Without having to mock or redeploy your changes.

Serverless Stack was originally launched in March 2017 as an open source guide for building full-stack serverless apps. Over the years tens of thousands of folks have used the guide to build their projects and businesses. [Here is just a small sample of what folks have built with Serverless Stack]({% link showcase.md %}). It has had an impact far greater than we could've imagined.

Over the years we realized that the local development experience for serverless really needed to be improved. There needed to be a better way to build and test your Lambda functions locally. So we created [SST]({{ site.sst_github_repo }}).

Our goal is to make it easy to build serverless apps. [And we'd like you to join our community on Slack]({{ site.slack_invite_url }}).

Serverless Stack is maintained mainly by Frank ([@fanjiewang](https://twitter.com/fanjiewang)) & Jay ([@jayair](https://twitter.com/jayair)) from [Anomaly Innovations](https://anoma.ly).
