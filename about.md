#### Serverless Stack is making it easy to build full-stack serverless applications.

Here are a couple of things we are doing.

# [Serverless Stack Framework]({{ site.sst_github_repo }})

The [Serverless Stack (SST) framework]({{ site.sst_github_repo }}) is an open source framework for building full-stack serverless applications. SST features a Live Lambda Development environment that allows you to work on your Lambda functions live. Without having to mock or redeploy your changes.

# [Serverless Stack Guide](/#guide)

The [Serverless-Stack.com](/) site was originally launched in March 2017 as an open source guide for building full-stack serverless apps. Over the years tens of thousands of folks have used the guide to build their projects and businesses. It's now the most widely read resource for serverless.
