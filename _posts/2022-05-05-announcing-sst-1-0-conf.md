You might’ve [heard about our v1 release](https://github.com/serverless-stack/sst/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta.26). As SST enters into a new phase, we wanted to do something special for our community. We are putting together a virtual community event to commemorate the launch!

[**SST 1.0 Conf**]({{ site.v1_conf_url }}) is a free virtual event happening on May 17th, 2022 at 9am PDT. [Register for the conference now]({{ site.v1_conf_url }}).

It’ll feature talks from the SST community about how they are using SST and serverless in their projects. Including folks from **Comcast**, **The LEGO Group**, **Analog Devices**, and **Shell**. We’ll also have a couple of live demos and workshops from the SST team.

We know you are all very busy and we don’t want to take up your entire day. So we decided to make the talks really short, around 10 minutes each. We hope you’ll be able to join us.

While most of the schedule has been finalized, we are looking for a couple more speakers. If you’d like to share something with the community, [fill out this short form](https://forms.gle/KTdbCLUy5oNwos2m7) and we’ll get in touch with you!

We want to use this event as a way to bring our community together. To share what we’ve all learnt over the last year of using SST.
