title: Moving to Discord

We are moving our Slack community to [Discord](https://discord.gg/sst)! While our Slack community has grown to over 2000 members, we feel that Discord is better aligned with supporting open source communities.

To join our Discord server, head over to: [**discord.gg/sst**](https://discord.gg/sst)

If you are curious about why we are moving to Discord, I shared some thoughts on this on Twitter.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We recently hit a big milestone for the SST community Slack.<br><br>2000+ members in a little over a year!<br><br>But we&#39;ve been considering a move to Discord.<br><br>Let me share what&#39;s been going on because I&#39;d like to hear what people think. <a href="https://t.co/pjtRx5UVBF">https://t.co/pjtRx5UVBF</a></p>&mdash; Jay (@jayair) <a href="https://twitter.com/jayair/status/1535360228631379973?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 10, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

We hope to see you in [Discord](https://discord.gg/sst) soon!

PS: The Slack community will be around while we transition.
